# Web Visualization Dashboard - Does it really get warmer as you get closer to the equator?

## This project takes a deeper look at this question using Open Weather Map APIs.

### The primary purpose of this analysis was to analyze how weather changes as you move closer towards the equator. To do this, I took 500+ cities around the world to find correlations between latitude and wind speeds, temperatures, cloudiness and humidity. The visualizations created in Matplotlib to show the following insights from the data:

* 1. Cities with latitudes closer to the equator are warmer than cities farther away from the equator.
* 2. A majority of the world's cities experience wind speeds of 20 mph or less. Fewer cities experience wind speeds of 20 mph or more.
* 3. Latitude does not necessarily have a big impact on the humidity of a city.
